## AI-PROJECT
The application of machine learning (ML) algorithms and other cognitive technologies in medical contexts is referred to as AI in healthcare. In its most basic form, AI refers to the ability of computers and other technologies to replicate human cognition, including the ability to learn, reason, and make decisions or take actions. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare involves the use of machines to evaluate and act on medical data, generally with the objective of predicting a certain outcome.
The application of machine learning and other cognitive sciences for medical diagnosis is a prominent AI use case in healthcare. AI may assist doctors and medical professionals in providing more accurate diagnosis and treatment plans by using patient data and other information.
